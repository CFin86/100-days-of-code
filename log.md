# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got started, Working through FCC JS Algorithms and Data Structs Cert

**Thoughts:** My first day! Read a little more about the challenge, Made my personal customizations of this repo. Nervous about tweeting out to people. Really want to hone in on and focus more of higher order functions. They're powerful but my understanding of them is not where I want it to be.

**Starting Excercise:** [Explore Differences Between the var and let Keywords](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/explore-differences-between-the-var-and-let-keywords/)
**Finishing Excercise** [Write Higher Order Arrow Functions](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/es6/write-higher-order-arrow-functions/)
